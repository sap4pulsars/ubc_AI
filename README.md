This repository is mostly a clone of https://github.com/zhuww/ubc_AI with some minor changes to quickclf.py. The neural network was developed by Aaron Berndsen and Weiwei Zhu. For more information, refer Zhu, W. W. et al. 2014 ApJ, 781, 117.

The current repository was created to build the docker wrapper for PICS neural network available on sap4pulsars/pics_ai.
